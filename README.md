## Description

This is a course review application developed using Java, Hibernate, SQL, and tested using JUnit and Mockito. This project focuses on demonstrating object-oriented programming, software architecture, design patterns, testing, as well as general best practices such as clean code and well-written commits.

The app, inspired by UVa's course forum, is operated through a command-line interface and allows users to create an account and view, add, or delete reviews for courses. Users can also add a course to the application that other users will be able to view and write reviews for as well.
